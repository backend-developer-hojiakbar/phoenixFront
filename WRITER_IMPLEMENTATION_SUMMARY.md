2. **WriterSubmitArticlePage.tsx** - Page for submitting new articles
3. **WriterMyArticlesPage.tsx** - Page to view and manage submitted articles
4. **WriterArticleDetailPage.tsx** - Detailed view of a specific article
5. **WriterProfilePage.tsx** - User profile management
6. **WriterDraftsManagementPage.tsx** - Management of article drafts
7. **WriterTestPage.tsx** - Simple test page for verification

## 3. Updated Routing

### Changes to App.tsx
- Added imports for all writer pages
- Added routes for all writer pages:
  - `/writer/dashboard`

2. **test-writer-login.js** - Script with functions to simulate login/logout
3. **test-writer.html** - HTML page for testing writer functionality
4. **src/writer-test-utils.ts** - TypeScript utilities for testing

## 8. Key Features Implemented

## 9. Technical Implementation Details

### Mock Data
All writer pages currently use mock data since there is no backend implementation yet. When the backend is ready:

1. Uncomment the API calls in each page
2. Replace mock data with actual API responses
3. Implement proper error handling

### Responsive Design
All writer pages follow the same responsive design patterns as the rest of the application:
- Mobile-first approach
- Responsive grid layouts
- Appropriate spacing and sizing for all screen sizes

### UI Components
Writer pages use the same UI components as other parts of the application:
- Cards
- Buttons
- Inputs
- Tables
- Alerts

### Authentication
Writer pages are protected and only accessible to users with the `WRITER` role.

## 10. Testing Instructions

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/#/writer/test` to access the test page
3. Or open `test-writer.html` in a browser
4. Use the default test credentials to log in
5. Navigate through the writer pages to verify functionality

## 11. Future Backend Integration

When implementing the backend for writers:

1. Create writer-specific API endpoints
2. Uncomment and implement API calls in writer pages
3. Update authentication to handle writer role properly
4. Implement proper data storage and retrieval for writer articles and drafts
5. Add database migrations for writer-related data
